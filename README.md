## ðŸ’¼ Project Overview

This project is a middleware-powered application designed to recommend anime based on user preferences. It is inspired by modern web technologies and implements a full-stack solution with a `Django` backend and a `React+VITE` frontend.

> **ðŸŒŸ Credits:** Special thanks to the author(s) of the site [Django React CRUD Tutorial](https://medium.com/django-unleashed/django-react-crud-a-simple-grocery-list-tutorial-7ae816d5832d), whose work inspired this project.

### ðŸ”¢ Setup Instructions
1. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Docker Compose**
   Update the `composed_app/docker-compose.yml` file:
   - Rename the frontend environment to match your GitHub Codespace UID.
   - For local setups, use `localhost` but ensure appropriate changes in the VITE app configuration.

3. **Build and Launch the Application**
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   > [!NOTE] 
   > Use this command only during the first setup. For subsequent runs, `docker-compose up` suffices.

4. **Access the Application**
   - Click on the `5173` port link that opens up.
   - If you're using GitHub Codespaces, you should see your unique codespace UID.

5. **Configure Database Visibility**
   - Ensure the visibility of the `8000` database port is set to **Public** for CORS to function correctly. 
   - This is especially relevant for Codespace deployments where all origins are selected.
